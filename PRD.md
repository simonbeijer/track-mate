  "status": "completed|in_progress",
  "completed_exercises": [
    {
      "exercise_id": "uuid",
      "name": "Bench Press",
      "completed_sets": [
        {
          "done": true,
          "weight": 100,
          "reps": 8
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Storage

4. App validates and creates workout session
5. User completes sets by checking "Done"
6. User optionally enters weights/reps
7. App saves progress automatically
8. User finishes workout

### Secondary Flow: Repeat Previous Workout
1. User opens app
2. User selects workout from history
3. App creates new session with previous values pre-filled
4. User modifies weights/reps as needed
5. User completes workout

## Success Metrics

**Engagement:**
- Time from JSON paste to first set completion < 30 seconds
- Workout completion rate > 80%
- Weekly active users returning to complete workouts

**Usability:**
